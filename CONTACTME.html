    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I graduated from FreeCodeCamp in 2017 and got my first job just o month
      after. With this job I redesigend the entire website and added content
      daily along with making the website secure and high performing. after that
      I got a job to make an iphone app. I heard what the company was hoping for
      and I made an amazing and high performing app that I still monotize to
      this day. I decided I wanted to freelance instead of getting a job at a
      company i had to go to everyday because I want to travel and see the world
      and luckly with this job that is somthing I am capable of so I am taking
      advantage of the oppertunity while I can! if you are interested in
      projects ive worked or are interested in hiring me check out my<strong>
